# About the Dockerfile

This is the Docker image for [fw4spl](https://github.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl).
This image contains all libraries, bundles and apps available in main fw4spl repository in a Debian sid environment.

## 1. Docker 

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. 
This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

So remember :

- a container is a stripped-to-basics version of a Linux operating system.
 
- an image is software you load into a container.

## 3. Windows issue

When you try to run an interactive shell on a Docker container via the Windows Docker client, you might receive the following error message:
```
docker exec -it myFW4SPL /bin/bash
cannot enable tty mode on non tty input
```
This error is caused by the Windows Git/PowerShell/MinGW/Cygwin Bash terminal, because it does not have full/correct support for TTY.
