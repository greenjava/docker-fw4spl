# About the Dockerfile

This is the Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/greenjava/docker-fw4spl/) for [fw4spl](https://github.com/fw4spl-org/fw4spl).

## 1. Docker 

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. 
This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

So remember :

- a container is a stripped-to-basics version of a Linux operating system.
- an image is software you load into a container.
